# Visualizing and Debugging Advent of Code (AoC) Day 12 and 17 

This repo demonstrates some ideas for using pictures/visualizations for helping
understanding what's going on in two of the problems from
[AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Mostly just for entertainment and exploring the idea of using visualizations to
help debugging and understanding what's going on under the hood.

## Day 12: a hill-climbing problem

Shows how having a nice visualization up your sleeve can help you see your own
mistakes

## Day 17: Tetris simulator

Can we just use a good picture to see repeating intervals? Yes!
